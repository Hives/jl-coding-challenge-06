# John Lewis Coding Challenge 06
## Functional filtering

The challenge is to make a filtering method in a functional style.

[All the
deets.](https://coding-challenges.jl-engineering.net/challenges/challenge-10/)

I made four versions:
- recursive
- looping, using mutability
- using Kotlin's `.fold()` method
- recursive, using tail recursion

Would be good to benchmark these methods. I expect the looping/mutable one will
be the fastest
